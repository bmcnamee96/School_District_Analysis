# School District Analysis

## Overview
The school district analysis took test scores for math and reading for 15 different schools in the area to see a variety of statistics: top and bottom performing schools, performance based on spending, performance based on size, and performance based on type. Due to some academic dishonesty, all scores from the 9th grade students at Thomas High School had to be removed. This removal had some affects on the analysis.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected
  - The district summary is not really affected because there are so many students and scores that removing a small number of them does not affect the averages.
- How is the school summary affected
  - The school summary is affected more than the district summary.  Thomas High School's summary was the only one affected and the percentages of students who passed math, reading, and both increased drastically.
- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
  - By replacing the ninth graders' scores, Thomas High School moved into the top 5 of performing schools. Before removing the scores, Thomas High School was in the middle of the pack, but after, the school moved into 2nd place.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
    - The only thing affected by removing the ninth grade students from Thomas High School is the grades of those students.  No other grades within the math and reading scores by grade dataframe are affected by this change.
  - Scores by school spending
    - Thomas High School increased the percentages for the $631-645 spending bin because of the large percentage increase of students who passed.
  - Scores by school size
    - Thomas High School increase the percentages for the Medium (1,000-1,999) sized schools because of the large increase in scores.
  - Scores by school type
